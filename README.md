# Implementation of 3D-UNet by pytorch
This is a 3D segmentation framework of UNet for medical volume by pytorch   
The network is inspired by [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/) and [3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric Segmentation from Sparse Annotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06650.pdf)
  
## How to use:  

**Dependencies**  
This work depends on the following libraries:  
Pytorch == 0.4.0  
Python == 3.6  

**Train**  
You can run the main.py to train the network and validate.

## Result
In my task (prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound, the input size is 224X225X175), I achieved a dice of 0.8 and 0.2946s per volume process speed.  
The Dice and Loss details is as follow:
